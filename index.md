##  Loan Default Risk Analysis: EDA & Risk Analytics in Banking
This project focuses on identifying patterns that indicate whether a client is likely to face difficulty in repaying their loan instalments. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to extract actionable insights that can help financial institutions make informed and data-driven lending decisions.

The goal is to:
Detect risk-prone applicants early,
Reduce the likelihood of loan defaults,
Support smarter lending strategies such as:Rejecting high-risk applicants,Adjusting loan amounts or terms,
Offering higher interest rates for riskier profiles,
ensuring that reliable customers are not wrongly declined.

Key Concepts:
1.Risk analytics in banking and financial services
2.Use of data to minimize financial loss due to defaults.
3.Identifying key variables and trends that signal repayment issues.

Tech Stack:
Language: Python
Libraries:NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn

Datasets Used:
Current Applications Dataset – Contains data of clients applying for loans.
Previous Applications Dataset – Historical data on past loan applications.

##  Bike Sharing Demand Prediction: Linear Regression Case Study
This project involves building a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes for an online bike-sharing company. By analyzing key features that influence bike rentals, the model aims to provide actionable insights that help the company optimize operations and align business strategies with customer demand.

Objective:
Predict daily demand for shared bikes based on available independent variables.
Help management understand how various factors (like weather, season, working days, etc.) affect bike rentals.
Support strategic planning for entering new markets by modeling demand dynamics.

Key Concepts:
1.Multiple Linear Regression.
2.Feature selection and model interpretation.
3.Business impact through data-driven insights.

Tech Stack:
Language: Python

Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Statsmodels

Dataset:
Bike Sharing App Dataset – Contains booking records and customer-related details for shared bike usage.

##  Lead Conversion Prediction: Logistic Regression Case Study
This project focuses on building a Logistic Regression model for an ed-tech company, X Education, to predict the likelihood of lead conversion. The company attracts industry professionals to its platform daily, but only a portion of these leads convert into customers.
By modeling lead behavior, we aim to generate a lead score (0 to 100) that reflects the probability of conversion. This enables the marketing and sales teams to focus efforts on high-potential leads and optimize their outreach strategies. 

Objective:
1.Predict the probability of lead conversion using logistic regression.
2.Assign a lead score to prioritize follow-up and marketing efforts.
3.Improve overall conversion rates through data-driven lead management.

Key Concepts:
1.Binary classification using Logistic Regression.
2.Feature engineering and model evaluation.
3.Data-driven marketing strategy

Tech Stack:
Language: Python

Libraries:NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn,Statsmodels

Dataset:
Lead Conversion Dataset – Contains user activity and metadata for website visitors, including information relevant to predicting conversion.
