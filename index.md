## EDA Case Study
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In this case study, apart from applying the techniques of EDA , we also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## Linear Regression Case Study
This case study  is a programming assignment wherein we build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes for an online bike sharing company.
We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
## Logistic Regression Case Study
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. 
By performing Logistic Regression on a dataset, we assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
